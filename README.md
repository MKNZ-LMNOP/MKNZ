**..........FRIDGERATR....................**



Hello and welcome, I'm still working on the details here, but so far there's a sketch of what the app is meant to do.

I hope to add increased functionality in the future, but for now, we have variables going to and from where they need to be.



Fridgeratr hopes to decrease your food waste by providing you a database to store your list of grocery items. When visiting the

"recipes" section, you will be able to find out what recipes you have the ingredients for, the aproximate amount of meals

that you have left and for how many people.

The app is skinless, but the skeleton is there. Right now I have a window that gives you the option to submit items to a database,

and a button which allows you to see some recipes and your stock of food items. Soon I will make the app compare the recipes and

stock of food.

Cleaned up the Fridge function, utilizing python's csv module rather than pandas. The fridge is just too small to warrant it's own SQL database.
