Ok so the basic idea of the app is that there will be a database of

ingredients and you will be able to see how many meals there are based on the ingredients you have in your ingredients database.





 	Kaggle db, "recipe-book"



 		--Reference ingredients in the cabinet against the recipe book.

 		--the meal db is also an option.

 

 

 	SQL Server, "Cabinet",



 		Keys:

 		--ingredient\_name   #string

 		--Quantity

 

 

 	a python with separate functions for

 		--adding/subtracting grocery items

 		--adding/subtracting recipes

 		--returning available recipes based on stock

 		--letting you know the estimated amount of meals you have

**#Having trouble placing the CSV file into SSM, may need to download a different DB.**

**#After that, it'll be watching some videos on SQL.**

**#AAAYYY DB is imported. Now I'll need something to pull from the Database. PANDAS.**

**#Welp, may have to download MySQL unless SSMS can connect with Python via an exposed port.**

**#SQLlite also seems like an option.**

**#Turns out SQL Lite is already installed, don't know how that happened. Uuuuhm**

**#Currently trying to use SQLalchemy as the solution bc Pandas**

**#The weekend set my mind free. I cam back and took SQLAlchemy out of the venv and put it into the parent folder**

**#Now VSCode can find SQLAlchemy**

**#Also installed pyodbc and pylint into 'ingredients\_app'**

**#I'm deleting the entire folder. I'm deleting the folder. We're starting anew.** 

**#VSC doesn't recognize my packages for no reason. This is lame. Boo.**
